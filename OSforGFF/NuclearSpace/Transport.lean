# Transport lemmas for standard nuclearity

This file provides infrastructure to **transport** nuclearity of the local Banach inclusions
between *equivalent* countable seminorm families.

Concretely, if `p q : ℕ → Seminorm ℝ E` are monotone and each seminorm in one family is bounded
by a constant times a finite supremum of the other (`Seminorm.IsBounded … LinearMap.id`), then:

- each individual seminorm is bounded by a constant times a **single** seminorm at some index
  (using monotonicity and `max` on finsets);
- the canonical inclusion map `BanachOfSeminorm (p m) → BanachOfSeminorm (p n)` (for `n < m`)
  can be factored through the `q`-levels using the constant-bounded inclusion maps
  `inclCLM_of_le_smul`;
- hence, if the corresponding inclusion between `q`-levels is nuclear, then so is the canonical
  inclusion between the chosen `p`-levels.

This is the key technical bridge needed to replace a “canonical” seminorm sequence (e.g. the
Schwartz diagonal sups) by any other equivalent seminorm sequence that is more convenient for
proving nuclearity.
