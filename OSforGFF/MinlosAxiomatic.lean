# Minlos theorem (hypothesis) and Gaussian measure construction

This module contains a **hypothesis** packaging Minlos' theorem (existence + uniqueness).
The non-axiomatic core lemmas (Gaussian characteristic functional and positive-definiteness
infrastructure) are in `OSforGFF/Minlos.lean`.

Nothing in the GFF development should rely on this hypothesis: the Gaussian uses are handled
by the proved pipeline in `OSforGFF/MinlosGaussianProved.lean`.

/-- Application of Minlos theorem to Gaussian measures.

If the covariance form can be realized as a squared norm via a linear embedding `T` into
a real inner product space `H`, then the Gaussian characteristic functional
`Φ(f) = exp(-½⟨f, Cf⟩)` satisfies the Minlos hypotheses. -/
