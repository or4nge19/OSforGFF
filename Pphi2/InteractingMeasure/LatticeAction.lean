# Lattice Interaction

Defines the Wick-ordered lattice interaction `V_a(φ) = a^d Σ_x :P(φ(x)):_a`
for P(Φ)₂ field theory on the finite lattice.

## Main definitions

- `latticeInteraction P d N a mass` — the interaction functional V_a
- `latticeAction P d N a mass` — the full lattice action S_a = ½⟨φ,(-Δ+m²)φ⟩ + V_a

## Mathematical background

The lattice action for P(Φ)₂ is:
  `S_a[φ] = ½ a^d Σ_{x,i} a⁻²(φ(x+eᵢ) - φ(x))² + a^d Σ_x (½m²φ(x)² + :P(φ(x)):_a)`

The quadratic part `½⟨φ, (-Δ_a + m²)φ⟩` is the Gaussian action (already in
gaussian-field as `latticeGaussianMeasure`). The interaction is:

  `V_a(φ) = a^d Σ_x :P(φ(x)):_a`

where `:P:_a` is Wick-ordered with constant `c_a = wickConstant d N a mass`.

/-- The Wick-ordered lattice interaction:

  `V_a(φ) = a^d · Σ_{x ∈ Λ} :P(φ(x)):_{c_a}`

where the sum is over all lattice sites and `:P:` is Wick-ordered with
respect to the lattice Gaussian covariance at coinciding points.

For d=2 on an N×N lattice, this is `a² Σ_x :P(φ(x)):_{c_a}`. -/

    wickPolynomial P (wickConstant d N a mass) (φ x)

/-- The lattice interaction is bounded below.

Since P has even degree n ≥ 4 with positive leading coefficient, each
`:P(φ(x)):` is bounded below by `-A` for some constant A depending on
P and c_a. Therefore `V_a(φ) ≥ -A · a^d · |Λ|`.

This is crucial for the well-definedness of `exp(-V_a)`. -/

/-- The lattice interaction is a sum of single-site functions.

`V_a(φ) = a^d · Σ_x :P(φ(x)):_{c_a}` depends on φ only through the values
φ(x) at individual lattice sites. This single-site structure is the key
property needed for the FKG inequality (via `fkg_perturbed` from gaussian-field).

Note: global convexity of V would be FALSE for typical P(Φ)₂ interactions
(e.g., P(τ) = τ⁴/4 - μτ² is not globally convex). But FKG does not need
convexity — the single-site decomposition suffices because products of
single-variable functions are automatically log-supermodular. -/
